  # Pro-README-GENERATOR
  
  > Keep smiling and work harder
  
  ## Description
  This application using Node.js allows a user to quickly and easily create a professional README for a new project from their input using the [Inquirer packages](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inquirer), answering the questions. The app will take the input given by the user and display information in the corresponding sections of the README file.
  <br>
  I was motivated to build this app due to the benefits of it. It makes the process of creating an open source project on GitHub become easier so the project creator can devote more time to working on the project.
